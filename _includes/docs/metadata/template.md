The first step is to make sure your metadata fields are titled according to the [CollectionBuilder Metadata Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14iWUEoAJ6T9WDqlPnIHRN7M8-YgmMV4_bjFPVuSZ0yk/edit?usp=sharing) (for CONTENTdm type).  Our template contains an example record to demonstrate the data format for each field.

For a more detailed description of how each format is defined and mapped, see the [CollectionBuilder Data Dictionary](/images/data_dictionary.pdf)

We recognize that each collection is different and may require metadata fields other than those in our template. We'll talk more about how you can add these in later in the Customization section. For now, we want to be sure you start with the fields required for CollectionBuilder to work.
