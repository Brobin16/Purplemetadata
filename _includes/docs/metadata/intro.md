CollectionBuilder has some metadata standards and formats that you'll need to follow in order for the site to work correctly. Follow the steps below to get your metadata ready.

***At this time, CONTENTdm's compound objects are not supported in CollectionBuilder.*** *If you have a compound object, link to it as a complete pdf.*

{% include bootstrap/alert.md color="warning" text="**If you have your own CONTENTdm metadata**, you should use it for the following section. **If you did not bring your own metadata**, you can use a set of our [collection metadata for practice](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vSyK0PKi6praKaR2viXo76XqRGzXi6e1?usp=sharing). For further use and experimentation, we also have [sample data sets](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-sample-data) available." %}

{% include bootstrap/alert.md color="info mb-4" text="**Before You Start:** To prevent formatting errors that can result from using software like Microsoft Excel, we recommend editing your metadata in Google Sheets. If your data will require a good amount of wrangling to get it into CollectionBuilder's format, we suggest you use [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/), a platform that facilitates large scale data cleaning and transformation." %}
