Refer to the [.theme.yml section](theme.html) for more information about customizing the various pages in your collection.

Each of these files is a CSV (comma separated values) file that is stored in the /_data/ directory of your repository. You can edit this using your text editor (recommended) or you can edit them using excel, Google Sheets, or another spreadsheet program.
