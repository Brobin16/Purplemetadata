CollectionBuilder was built to be used by a wide variety of users, so we've tried to make the tool as easy to use as possible. Some initial set-up is required, especially for our Stand-Alone and Skin versions--these require the installation of Ruby and Jekyll on a personal computer. 

Once the initial set-up is complete users will be able to create their collections through adjustments to metadata and to config files. 

Let's get the bad news out there, **the Skin and Stand Alone versions of CollectionBuilder require that you use, sparingly, the [command line](commandline.html).** 

We know this is not ideal for many users, but we're hoping that in using these tools, users will become more comfortable in these environments generally, which will lead to more confidence with the tools. 

And one of our goals in building this is to give power back to users of systems whose design so often obscures any customization or features from any but the most technically sophisticated.
