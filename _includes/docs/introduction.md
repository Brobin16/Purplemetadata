{{page.title}} - {{page.collection}}

CollectionBuilder was built to be used by a wide variety of users, so we've tried to make the tool as easy to use as possible. Some initial set-up is required, especially for our Stand-Alone and Skin versions--these require the installation of Ruby and Jekyll on a personal computer. 

Once the initial set-up is complete, however, users will be able to create their collections through adjustments to metadata and to config files.
