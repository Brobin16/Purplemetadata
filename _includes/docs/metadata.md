[Our Metadata Page]({{'/metadata/' | relative_url}}) should help you investigate all our recomendations for the metadata. 

We want to point out here the **required elements**: 

- title
- format - this is the most important field for setting up the various displays and interactive visualizations. Options
- objectid
- cdm-id (for contentdm skin)

There are also **optional but important elements** to be aware of: 

- latitude and longitude -- these are two separate fields that will enable the map view. See our page on the map visualization to learn how to find lat/longs for your items.
- date - Date should always be in the format **yyyy-mm-dd**, which will enable our various timeline visualiations. See our Timeline page for more details
- subject - the subject field will create the word cloud that allows visualizations of the amount of subjects used within the collection. *The field needs to be named 'subject' (not 'subjects')* for the visualization to work. See our Subject page for more information. 
- location - much like the subject field, this field will build a tag cloud of the most used locations in your collection. See the location page for more information.
