        <h3>What is CollectionBuilder?</h3>
        <p>CollectionBuilder is an open source tool for creating digital collection and exhibit websites driven by
            metadata, and powered by modern static web technology that works through two basic steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The user provides a well structured metadata spreadsheet and a directory of digital files,</li>
            <li>CollectionBuilder processes the metadata to generate a variety of visualizations--surfacing the unique
                facets and features of the content, creating interactive pathways to browse and discover items while
                providing overall context.</li>
        </ol>

        <p >Each visualization is configurable using a few basic variables or config files.</p>

        <p>Each is a self contained static web page that can be hosted on the most basic web servers without the need
            for a database or server-side processing language, enabling simple security and speedy performance. </p>

        <h2>Concept</h2>

        <p>The growing maturity of static generators such as Jekyll, offer a robust and viable alternative to
            traditional content management systems for creating efficient and secure websites requiring a fraction of
            the server overhead, while allowing a more flexible and unique front end.
            Thus, CollectionBuilder shifts energy away from clicking buttons on heavy DAMS platform interfaces, and back
            on creating the clean, polished metadata and objects fundamental to digital libraries--building collections
            as data.</p>

        <p>
            This shift to focusing on clean data and simple systems enables a more agile and responsive approach,
            allowing iterative development of features, gradual acquisition of developer skills, and flexible migration
            between hosts without the need for deep investment.
            There will still be learning curves and frustration, to be sure, but by removing some of the overwrought
            features and extensive infrastructure requirements of library systems currently used and developed today,
            the Lib-STATIC methodology ensures those central library values of usability and accessibility are primary
            to any tool developed following its principles.
        </p>

        <h2>Design</h2>

        <p>
            CollectionBuilder is built on top of a stack of popular, mature, and well documented web development tools
            including Bootstrap front-end framework and JavaScript libraries such as jQuery and Leaflet, but aims to
            keep dependencies simple and easy to manage.
            The project consists of a template of modular HTML, SASS, JavaScript, and Ruby components which are knit
            together by Jekyll to generate a complete static site (i.e. a folder of HTML, CSS, JSON, and JavaScript
            files).
        </p>

        <p>
            The plain text source code files are easily version controlled with Git, enabling collaboration and project
            management on cloud platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
            Jekyll provides a local development server, simplifying iterative testing (and learning) and eliminating the
            need for a test server.
            For public deployment, the output folder of static site assets can be copied onto a basic web server (no
            server-side processing or database is required), or can be served directly by free services such as GitHub
            Pages or GitLab Pages, that provide automatic Jekyll building and hosting.
        </p>

        <h3>
            CollectionBuilder projects are:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Agile (investment in data and fundamental skills, rather than in heavy infrastructure, enables
                responsive change)
            <li>Future-ready (simple data based system is always ready for migration to other platforms)</li>
            <li>Preservation-ready (organized projects which clearly separate presentation from data, provide packages
                ready for longterm digital preservation)
            </li>
        </ul>
<hr class="col-8 offset-2 my-4 " />
        <h3>We envision CollectionBuilder being used by libraries and cultural heritage institutions in three main ways:
        </h3>

        <ol>
            <li>The creation of stand-alone library digital collections and exhibits hosted on basic static web
                infrastructure.
            </li>
            <li>The creation of "skins" to provide better UX and context on top of existing digital collection
                management systems (such as CONTENTdm).</li>
            <li>As a pedagogical tool for learning about digital collection development and fundamental data and
                web skills.</li>
        </ol>

<h2> Current projects</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-gh">CollectionBuilder-GH</a> - A simple
                template for hands-on teaching about digital libraries, designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages.
                It can be used in a workshop setting to take participants through digitization and metadata
                creation, to having a live collection site for free. An static alternative to teaching with full
                scale DAMS such as Omeka.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-contentdm">CollectionBuilder-Skin for CONTENTdm </a>-
                 in-development version of CollectionBuilder used by the University of Idaho Library to create
                "skins" for the digital library collections they maintain via a hosted CONTENTdm instance. Will
                be developed into a generic CONTENTdm "skin" that can be adopted by others. </li>
        </ul>
