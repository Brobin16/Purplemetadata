**Funded Opportunities:**

Check out the 2023 Incentives Program, the latest grant-funded opportunity for using and contributing to CollectionBuilder:

CollectionBuilder's 2022 Institute of Museum and Library Services grant is funding several opportunities for users to engage with CollectionBuilder and provide formal feedback to the development team.
The incentives are divided into a few target audiences with slightly different expectations for engagement.
In each category, participants will be awarded a stipend for their work using, documenting, and developing CollectionBuilder. 

Application to the program categories will be on a flexible timeline to match interest and project team objectives.
Applications will be reviewed by the project team; we are committed to selecting participants from a wide range of institution types and backgrounds.

**Incentive opportunities and their respective deadlines are described in more detail below**, along with information on how to apply.
Please reach out to [juliastone@uidaho.edu](mailto:juliastone@uidaho.edu) with any questions.

Our highest hope for this project is to enable a small army of librarians to develop the type of tools and sites that keep the GLAM professionals in control and not subservient to bloated infrastructures and/or third-party contracts. We hope you will feel drawn to help us build that community.
