CollectionBuilder's 2022 Institute of Museum and Library Services grant is funding several opportunities for users to engage with CollectionBuilder and provide formal feedback to the development team.
The incentives are divided into a few target audiences with slightly different expectations for engagement.
In each category, participants will be awarded a stipend for their work using, documenting, and developing CollectionBuilder. 

Application to the program categories will be on a flexible timeline to match interest and project team objectives.
Applications will be reviewed by the project team; we are committed to selecting participants from a wide range of institution types and backgrounds.

**Incentive opportunities and their respective deadlines are described in more detail below**, along with information on how to apply.
Please reach out to [juliastone@uidaho.edu](mailto:juliastone@uidaho.edu) with any questions.

## CollectionBuilder Curriculum Development Program

**Eligibility**: Full- or part-time instructors at ALA-accredited Information and Library Science (ILS) programs

**Application deadline**: May 22, 2023

**Description**: Do you teach (or want to teach) students how to create digital collections? We're looking to provide stipends to instructors who are interested in incorporating CollectionBuilder into their ILS classroom and willing to provide the CollectionBuilder team with feedback on the teaching experience. CollectionBuilder is a fantastic option for those wishing to teach students the critical components of digital curation while also introducing fundamental web development and data literacy skills including Google Sheets, Git, Markdown, HTML, CSS, and Jekyll. CollectionBuilder's thorough [documentation]({{ '/cb-docs/' | relative_url }}), open codebase and scaffolded technical infrastructure make it easily customizable to your teaching goals, and students will walk away with free, long-lasting digital collection sites that they can add to their portfolios. Not familiar with static web? No problem. CollectionBuilder is designed for beginners, and the CollectionBuilder team is committed to providing support and resources from existing course modules as you develop your curriculum.

**Timeline**: Selected participants will develop course modules for use in Fall 2023 or Spring 2024 classes.

**Requirements**:
- Incorporate CollectionBuilder into your Information and Library Science (ILS) class
- Submit feedback and attend a follow-up virtual meeting with the CollectionBuilder team to discuss the experience

**Stipend**: Each participant will receive a $2,000 stipend.

**Stipends Available**: 3

**How to apply**: Applicants should prepare a short (1-2 paragraph) description of how they plan to integrate CollectionBuilder into their course. For full consideration, apply through the [CollectionBuilder Curriculum Development Program Application Form](#) by May 22, 2023. The CollectionBuilder team will select three applicants to participate in this program, and will notify applicants of their decision by June 1, 2023.
