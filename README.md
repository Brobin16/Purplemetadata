# CollectionBuilder

CollectionBuilder is a set of Jekyll projects for building library digital collection, exhibit, and publication websites driven by metadata, following the [Lib-STATIC](https://lib-static.github.io/) development methodology.

CollectionBuilder is focused on creating collections as data.
After creating well structured metadata and a directory of digital files, the tool generates a static website for visualizing, browsing, and accessing the collection.
An experiment in "minimal computing", CollectionBuilder provides a depth of learning opportunities and development possibilities, allowing users to take complete ownership over the project and make their work open to the world. 

The growing maturity of static generators such as Jekyll, offer a robust and viable alternative to traditional content management systems for creating efficient and secure websites requiring a fraction of the server overhead, while allowing a more flexible and unique front end.
Thus, CollectionBuilder shifts energy away from clicking buttons on heavy DAMS platform interfaces, and back on creating the clean, polished metadata and objects fundamental to digital libraries.
This shift to focusing on clean data and simple systems enables a more agile and responsive approach, allowing iterative development of features, gradual acquisition of developer skills, and flexible migration between hosts without the need for deep investment. 
There will still be learning curves and frustration, to be sure, but by removing some of the overwrought features and extensive infrastructure requirements of so many library systems currently used and developed today, the Lib-STATIC methodology ensures those central library values of usability and accessibility are primary to any tool developed following its principles.

We envision CollectionBuilder being used by libraries and cultural heritage institutions in three main ways: 

1. the creation of stand-alone library digital collections and exhibits hosted on basic static web infrastructure.
2. the creation of "skins" to provide better UX and context on top of existing digital collection management systems (such as CONTENTdm).
3. as a pedagogical tool for learning about digital collection development and fundamental data and web skills. 

Current projects:

- [collectionbuilder-gh](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-gh) - A simple template for hands-on teaching about digital libraries, designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages. It can be used in a workshop setting to take participants through digitization and metadata creation, to having a live collection site for free. An static alternative to teaching with full scale DAMS such as Omeka.
- [collectionbuilder-cdm-template](https://github.com/uidaholib/collectionbuilder-cdm-template) - A in development version of CollectionBuilder used by the University of Idaho Library to create "skins" for the digital library collections they maintain via a hosted CONTENTdm instance. Will be developed into a generic CONTENTdm "skin" that can be adopted by others. 

More information coming soon!
