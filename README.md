# CollectionBuilder

A set of Jekyll projects for building library digital collection, exhibit, and publication websites driven by metadata.

CollectionBuilder is focused on creating collections as data. 
After creating well structured metadata and a directory of digital files, the tool generates a website for visualizing, browsing, and accessing the collection.
An experiment in "minimal computing", CollectionBuilder provides a depth of learning opportunities and development possibilities, allowing users to take complete ownership over the project and make their work open to the world. 

Information coming soon!
