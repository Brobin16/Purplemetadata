## What is your Design Philosophy?

CollectionBuilder builds digital collection sites that encourage investigation and discovery. Our item and visualization pages are built with connections between them so that a user can follow their own interests when exploring a digital collection.

## How does that work in practice?

{% include bootstrap/image.md class="col-md-8 float-right ml-3 my-2" img="dlf-presentation.jpg"%}

For example, if a user were interested in seeing all the images in our [Barnard Stockbridge Photography Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/barstock/) pertaining to the 1910 "Big Burn" forest fire, they could [browse the collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/barstock/browse.html#fire) by searching for "fire" on the browse page. 

Then, when looking at individual item pages, they could link out to the year [1910](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/barstock/timeline.html#1910) on the timeline page and see the wide variety of images collected during that year by the studio. 

And perhaps that would lead them to investigate some other [subject terms](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/barstock/subjects.html) or to focus on a particular town [via the map](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/barstock/map.html). 

As one examines these collections more closely, one can get a larger sense of the collection and the era, as well as its connection to one's own area and time frame. 

***Our intention is to connect users to the collection in order for them to uncover the accretive magic of cultural heritage collections.***
