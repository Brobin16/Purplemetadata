## What Makes CollectionBuilder Go?

CollectionBuilder uses 4 main components: 

1. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - a static website builder (i.e. NO SERVERS!!!) that builds websites from data files using the [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/) templating language (which you don't need to know, but which is easily readable and usable) and [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files for content
2. [Git/GitHub](https://github.com/) - a way to collaborate, track changes, and import pre-built services
3. [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) - a CSS/Javascript Package for easier development
4. Data Files - We use [Comma Separated Values (CSV) files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) that are just simple version of a spreadsheet and text files written in [YAML (.yml)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), which are basically lists formatted in a specific fashion.

## What are you using to build the visualizations and display features? 

Our visualizations and features are built using a combination of our own designs with a variety of open source libraries (all of which are contained within each repository to promote site sustainability). All code is available for customization. 

The open source libraries include: 

- [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) - for an automatically generated Table on our data pages. 
- [Leafletjs](http://leafletjs.com/) - for our maps. 
- [lightGallery](http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/) - for images on our item pages. 
- [TimelineJS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/) - for an optional timeline visualization. 
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes)
- [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/).
