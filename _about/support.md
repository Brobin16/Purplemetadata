## Where is your support coming from?

CollectionBuilder receives ongoing support in the form of staff support, development time, and funding from the University of Idaho Library. 

From 2019 to 2021, we were supported by a [National Leadership Grants for Libraries from the Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS)]((https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-34-19-0064-19-0) ) that helped us to build, document, and promote CollectionBuilder. 

We are also currently working with colleagues from the University of Oregon on a Digital Humanities Advancement grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) to develop digital humanities instructional modules for static web based projects and learning outcomes.
