## Where is your support coming from?

CollectionBuilder receives ongoing support in the form of staff support, development time, and funding from the [University of Idaho Library](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/).

We are currently supported by a *National Leadership Grants for Libraries* from the [Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS)](https://www.imls.gov/), titled ["Growing CollectionBuilder, A Sustainable Digital Exhibit Framework and Static Web Development Model"](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-252326-ols-22){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, 2022 - 2024.

We are also currently working with colleagues from the University of Oregon on a [Digital Humanities Advancement grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH)](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&gn=HAA-281018-21) to develop digital humanities instructional modules for static web based projects and learning outcomes. 
More can be found about our NEH project via it's GitHub Organization, [Learn-Static](https://github.com/learn-static).

From 2019 to 2021, we were supported by a [National Leadership Grants for Libraries from the Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS)](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-34-19-0064-19){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} that helped us to build, document, and promote CollectionBuilder.
