## Who is supporting this project?

CollectionBuilder receives ongoing support in the form of staff support, development time, and funding from the University of Idaho Library. 

From 2019 to 2021, we were supported by a planning grant from the Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) that helped us to build, document, and promote CollectionBuilder. 

In 2019, CollectionBuilder's development team received an IMLS-sponsored National Leadership Grants for Libraries [Planning Grant](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-34-19-0064-19-0) to refine and promote CollectionBuilder.
