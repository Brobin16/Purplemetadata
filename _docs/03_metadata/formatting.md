## 6. Formatting Your Metadata
{% include bootstrap/alert.md color="primary col-md-4 float-right ml-4 mb-4 mt-2" text="**Tip:** In Visual Studio Code, there's **an easy way to make your fields lowercase**: 
1. Highlight the first row of your CSV (the row containing field titles) 
2. Click the 'Command Pallette' option in the View menu 
3. Start typing 'Transform to lowercase'--the option will appear!" %}

Make sure you're following the guidelines below, otherwise CollectionBuilder will not work.

- **Field Titles Need To Be Lowercase**
    - Before you upload your metadata to CollectionBuilder, make sure **all field titles are lowercase**.
    - CollectionBuilder will not work if the field titles are not lowercase. 

- **Use a Semi-colon When You Have Multiple Values**
    - Use a semi-colon (`;`) to separate values in multi-valued fields

- **Avoid Special Characters**
    - When creating **objectids**, **filenames**, and **identifers**, avoid using hyphens (`-`), spaces (` `), and special characters (`&`)
