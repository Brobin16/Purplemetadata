To begin, locate and open the **_config.yml** file in the base of your repository. **No matter which version you're using**, this file is used to configure the basics of your site. For CONTENTdm skin users, this is where you will connect your CONTENTdm collection to CollectionBuilder, so that CollectionBuilder can use CONTENTdm's API to generate the images, pdfs, and other downloadable files that will make up your collection.
