## Table Configuration (config-table.csv)

The table appears on the "Data" page. It uses [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) to generate a table that can be searched, sorted, and downloaded as a whole or in a filtered version.

We recommend not using more than 5 or 6 fields here, as the table can become overcrowded. 

- **field** - Determines the field that is displayed on the pop-up. 
- **display** - Determines the label given to the field.
