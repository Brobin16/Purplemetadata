The advanced options below demonstrate ways to incorporate additional features and/or repurpose and extend current visualization features. We call them advanced but as you get familiar with the tool and the [Liquid templating language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/), we hope their relative ease-of-use becomes apparent. 

1. [Building a TimelineJS Feature](#timelinejs)
2. [Repuruposing the Table-based Timeline Visualization](#repurposetimeline)
3. [Creating New Cloud Pages](#cloud)
4. [Workflow for Multiple Collections (Skin)](#workflow)
