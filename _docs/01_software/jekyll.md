## 4. Install Jekyll

Finally, we get to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)!
Jekyll is a static site generator that uses templates and data to build out websites. 
It is a very popular project used by tiny and giant projects. 

Jekyll is a Gem, a software package installed via Ruby's management system called RubyGems (similar to Python's Pip). 
Gem is a command line application, so again we will open a terminal to give it commands.
Once you have a terminal open, type in:

`gem install jekyll bundler`

{% include bootstrap/alert.md text="This will take awhile as the Gem installs all the dependencies and builds extensions (on Windows it may appear as if nothing is happening, but be patient!)." color="warning" %}

Your dev environment is ready! Give yourself a hand!
