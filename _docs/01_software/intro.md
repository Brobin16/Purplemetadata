To get started editing code, managing your project, and building websites with CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm you will need: 

1. [Text Editor](#text-editor)
2. [Git](#git) (version control system)
3. [Ruby](#ruby) (programming language)
4. [Jekyll](#jekyll) (static web site generator)

Installing software on your computer can be the biggest hurdle to getting started with CollectionBuilder. Our advice is to stick with it. Having your local "development environment" for a Jekyll-based project set up will be rewarding, allowing you to edit code and see how the website changes right on your laptop.

If those options fail, try Google. If Google doesn't help, email [Evan](mailto:ewilliamson@uidaho.edu)--he's probably not doing anything.
