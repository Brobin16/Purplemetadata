Getting the software installed on your computer is typically the biggest hurdle to getting started with tools like CollectionBuilder. 
So stick with it, even if you run into issues. 
Having your local "development environment" for a Jekyll-based project set up will be rewarding, allowing you to edit code and see how the website changes right on your laptop.

To get started editing code, managing your project, and building websites with CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm you will need: 

1. [Text Editor](#text-editor)
2. [Git](#git) (version control system)
3. [Ruby](#ruby) (programming language)
4. [Jekyll](#jekyll) (static web site generator)

This section will walk you through installing software and provide a brief overview how this *development environment* fits together.
