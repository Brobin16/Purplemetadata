CollectionBuilder was built to be used by a wide variety of users, so we've tried to make the tool as easy to use as possible. Some initial set-up is required, especially for our Stand-Alone and Skin versions, as these require the installation of Ruby and Jekyll on a personal computer. 

Once the initial set-up is complete users will be able to create their collections through adjustments to metadata and to config files. 

A note: *The Skin and Stand Alone versions of CollectionBuilder require that you use the [command line](#using-the-command-line) when installing the software and starting up the development server. We hope the tool is a way for those who are a little apprehensive about using the command line, to learn to tolerate it.*

This is also not a GUI based tool, or one that you sign into and push buttons. It requires that you edit text and csv files in order to make changes. We hope that by participating in this type of process, users will become more comfortable in these environments generally, which will lead to more confidence with the tools. 

One of our main goals in building CollectionBuilder is to give power back to users of systems whose design so often obscures any customization or features from any but the most technically sophisticated.
