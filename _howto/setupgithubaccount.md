    You can opt to pay for the plan if you'd like, but you can also select to have the free version which has all of the features necessary to make your website.

5. After selecting the "Free" option, it will take you to another page that will ask you a series of questions about your programming experience and what you plan to use GitHub for. Answer the questions, or opt to "Skip this Step" at the bottom of the page. After you answer the questions, you can select "Complete Setup."
6. Then GitHub will send you an email to the email you used to set up your account. Open that email and verify your email.
