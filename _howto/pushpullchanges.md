title: How To Push and Pull Commits to a Repository (GitHub Desktop Edition)
---

When you make edits with your code, either online or in your text editor, you will be prompted to commit your changes. Think of it as "saving" your changes. These changes can be viewed by everyone in your collaborative group, if you have one, by *pushing* these changes to your GitHub. *Pulling* changes means that you are "downloading" commits made by someone else or from another source so that you can view them.

### Committing Changes with GitHub Desktop

1. After you've made some edits and changes with your code, you will see all of your changes in a sidebar in GitHub Desktop.

2. This sidebar will show whether these edits consisted of deleting a file, modifying a file, or adding a file based on the icon next to each change.

3. Before committing your changes, you will have to add a summary to your commit. This way, team members can know the change that was made.

4. Commit the change

### Pushing Changes to GitHub

1. Once your changes have been committed, you'll see the number of commits next to "Push Origin" on the right of the top bar displaying your repository and branch.

2. Select "Push Origin." This allows your changes to be seen by your team members and others through your GitHub  repository online.
