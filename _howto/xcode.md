# Installing X-Code

Xcode is a software bundle that contains the program Git, which is needed for working with Collection Builder. It is the easiest way to install Git on Mac OS. Before you download this entire software bundle though, we do want to let you know it is a relatively large file, 7.8 GB, and that there are alternative ways to download this software if your computer does not have the space. 

## Step 1 Install

- Go to your app store and type in Xcode. The app should look like this.

- Click the download button. The software should automatically download.

## Step 2 Confirm Git Has Been Installed

You're going to want to do a quick check to make sure that git was successfully installed on your computer. It's a quick and easy process. 

- First, you need to open your search bar. On a Mac, the easiest way to do this is to press command + space bar. Once there, as pictured below, type the word terminal and hit enter.

- A black window, shown below, will appear with some words stating your user info. Next to it type git --version, and press enter.

- A confirmation, as you can see circled below, will appear in your terminal line. If you see "git version" with the specific version listed next to it, you have successfully installed the software.
